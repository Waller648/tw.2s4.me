# tw.2s4.me Server

The original production code has been adapted to be runnable by a wider variety of willing instance operators for TWR (Textwall Ripoff). Contributions are welcome.

## Prerequisites
1. Node.js (preferrably >= v20)

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` in the repository directory
3. Go over settings.json in the data/ directory and update as needed
4. Run `cd src` and then `node server.js`
5. The `textwall` account will need to be created manually, so make sure nobody else can register it before you can

## General information
- The client code was directly taken from textwall.cc
- tw.2s4.me was created following its temporary shutdown in 2023
- The server code was written from scratch based on acquired knowledge of the protocol
